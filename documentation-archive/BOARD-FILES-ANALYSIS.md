# Board Files Analysis - V6 to V7

## Current State in Workspace

Checking what board-related files currently exist...

## Files We Have:
- board.html
- boards.html  
- boards-documentation.html
- save_board.php
- data/ppm-boards.json
- data/ppm-users.json

## Files We Need to Check from V6:
- ppm-script.js (board JavaScript)
- ppm-style.css (board styles)
- ppm-boards.json (board data structure)
- ppm-users.json (user data)
- Any other board-related files

## Investigation Steps:
1. Extract all board files from main branch
2. Compare with current workspace
3. Identify missing files
4. Analyze board creation code in V6
5. Port to V7 ensuring no interference with workflows
